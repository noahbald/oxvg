# Oxidised Vector Graphics

OXVG is an effort to create high-performance SVG tooling.

It's planned to include transforming, optimising, and linting, all written in Rust.

## ðŸŽ¯ Tools

The following tools will be available in a CLI binary.

### ðŸª¶ Optimiser

An SVG optimiser similar to [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) is in the works and is showing to be [multiple times faster](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg/wiki/Benchmarks) on some tasks.

Please be aware that this isn't an exact clone of SVGO and certain differences may be found. If you rely on stability, for the time being we recommend sticking to SVGO.

You can read more about these differences and why in [this wiki page](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg/wiki/Optimiser#svgo-parity).

### ðŸ¤– Transformer (Planned)

An SVG transformer similar to Inkscape's actions is planned.

### ðŸ§¹ Linter (Planned)

A basic linter similar to svglint is planned to make catching issues in SVG documents much easier.

## ðŸ“– Libraries

If you're a Rust developer wanting to work with SVGs in your project, we have a set of crates at your disposal.
As of now though, we're quite unstable and certain crates may be updated, merged, or moved as we see fit.

### [Actions](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg/tree/main/crates/oxvg_actions) (pre-alpha)

These are where the commands for our transformer will live and will contain a set of actions to manipulate SVGs.

### [AST](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg/tree/main/crates/oxvg_ast) (beta)

This crate provides a set of traits that can be used to implement a DOM similar to that of the browser web standards. Though it's not a 1-to-1 match; it's designed for easily traversing and manipulating the DOM.

There's currently an implementation with markup5ever's rcdom which can do the following

- Parse and serialize XML, SVG, and HTML documents
- Commonly used browser API implementations for DOM nodes, elements, attributes, etc.
- An implementation of [selectors](https://docs.rs/selectors/0.26.0/selectors/) for using DOM CSS queries

#### [Style](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg/tree/main/crates/oxvg_ast/src/style.rs)

This crate uses lightningcss to provide some shortcuts for using CSS with our AST.

- Parsing presentation attributes as CSS (hopefully this can be ported to lightningcss)
- Collecting the computed styles of a HTML element

### [Optimiser](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg/tree/main/crates/oxvg_optimiser) (beta)

This is where the jobs (i.e. SVGO plugins) for our optimiser live and can also be used as a library for use in your applications.

### [Path](https://github.com/noahbald/oxvg/tree/main/crates/oxvg_path) (beta)

This is a library for parsing, optimising, and serialising path definitions (e.g. `<path d="..." />`).

It's mostly complete and good to use in your application, though expect some changes as we may include feature to enable simple manipulations for paths in the future.

## ðŸ’­ Other future ideas

The future potential of this project is still undecided. The following may be available some point in the future.

- NPX & NPM bindings
- A web frontend comparable to InkScape
- A TUI frontend

## Building

This project is currently in very early development and doesn't have any distributions yet.
You can run the project for yourself by doing the following

```sh
git clone git@github.com:noahbald/oxvg.git
cargo build --package oxvg
./target/debug/oxvg.exe --help
```

Or you can try running it through `cargo` instead

```sh
cargo run -- --help
```
